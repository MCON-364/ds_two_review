/**
 * Homework 3 - Concurrent Event Log (ConcurrentSkipListMap + ExecutorService)
 *
 * Scenario: a distributed system fires events from many threads at once.
 * Each event has a timestamp (epoch millis) and a message string.
 * The log must store events in time order, be safe for concurrent writes,
 * and support efficient range queries after all threads have finished.
 *
 * This homework practises:
 * - ConcurrentSkipListMap as a thread-safe sorted map (the concurrent TreeMap).
 * - Why we need a unique key strategy when two events arrive at the same
 *   millisecond — use AtomicLong as a tie-breaker.
 * - ExecutorService to simulate concurrent event sources.
 * - Stream operations on the resulting sorted map.
 *
 * Before coding, think about:
 * - What happens if two events share the same Long key in the map? One overwrites the other!
 * - ConcurrentSkipListMap is sorted by Long key. What chronological ordering does that give?
 * - headMap, tailMap, and subMap return live views of the map.
 *   What does "live" mean here, and is that safe after all writers have stopped?
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - logEvent(timestamp, message) records the event. If two events share a
 *   timestamp, both must be stored. Use composite key:
 *     timestamp * 1_000_000L + sequence.getAndIncrement()
 * - runConcurrentSources(sources, eventsEach) uses an ExecutorService to have
 *   each source log eventsEach events, then waits for completion.
 * - getEventsAfter(timestamp) returns all events logged after the given timestamp, in order.
 * - getEventsBetween(from, to) returns events in [from, to] inclusive.
 * - getMostRecentN(n) returns the n most recent events as an immutable list, newest first.
 *
 * Do not use synchronized blocks. Rely on ConcurrentSkipListMap and AtomicLong.
