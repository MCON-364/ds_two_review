/**
 * In-class Exercise 2 — Employee Roster (TreeMap + TreeSet + Streams)
 *
 * Scenario: a company has employees spread across several departments.
 * You need to organise them so that departments are listed alphabetically
 * and employees within each department are also sorted alphabetically by name.
 *
 * This exercise practises:
 * - TreeMap<String, TreeSet<Employee>> as a two-level sorted structure.
 * - Collectors.groupingBy with a TreeSet downstream collector.
 * - Stream flatMap to merge employees from all departments into one list.
 * - NavigableMap range queries (departments A-M vs N-Z).
 *
 * Before coding, think about:
 * - Why do we use TreeSet inside the map rather than ArrayList?
 * - What comparator drives the ordering inside each TreeSet?
 * - If two employees have the same name and department but different salaries,
 *   are they considered the same element inside the TreeSet?
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - The constructor receives the list of employees.
 * - buildRoster() returns a TreeMap<String, TreeSet<Employee>> grouping
 *   employees by department. Both the departments and the employees within
 *   each department must be in sorted order.
 * - getTopEarnerPerDepartment() returns a Map<String, Employee> with the
 *   highest-paid employee in each department.
 * - getAllEmployeesSorted() returns all employees across all departments in
 *   a single sorted list (alphabetical by name).
 * - getDepartmentsInRange(from, to) returns a NavigableMap slice containing
 *   only the departments whose names fall in [from, to] inclusive.
 *
 * Do not use explicit loops. Use streams and collectors.
