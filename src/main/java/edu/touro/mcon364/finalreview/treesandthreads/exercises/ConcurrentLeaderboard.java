/**
 * In-class Exercise 3 - Concurrent Leaderboard (ConcurrentSkipListSet + ExecutorService)
 *
 * Scenario: a game server receives score submissions from many player threads at
 * the same time. The leaderboard must always reflect current top scores in
 * sorted order (highest first) and must be safe when read and written concurrently.
 *
 * This exercise practises:
 * - ConcurrentSkipListSet as the thread-safe sorted cousin of TreeSet.
 * - Why TreeSet is NOT safe for concurrent access.
 * - ExecutorService and Runnable to simulate concurrent score submissions.
 * - AtomicInteger for a safe submission counter.
 * - Stream operations to produce a ranked snapshot from the sorted set.
 *
 * Before coding, think about:
 * - What would happen if two threads called TreeSet.add() simultaneously?
 * - ConcurrentSkipListSet keeps elements sorted by compareTo.
 *   Look at ScoreEntry.compareTo: which score appears first in iteration?
 * - Each ScoreEntry is unique by (playerName, score, timestamp).
 *   If a player submits a new score, does the old one disappear?
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - submitScore(entry) adds a ScoreEntry thread-safely.
 * - getTopN(n) returns the top n ScoreEntry objects as an immutable list, highest first.
 * - getTotalSubmissions() returns the number of times submitScore has been called.
 * - runSimulation(players, scoresEach) uses an ExecutorService to have each player
 *   submit scoresEach random scores concurrently, then shuts down the pool and waits.
 *
 * Do not use synchronized blocks. Rely on ConcurrentSkipListSet and AtomicInteger.
